The Fangshan District in southern part of Beijing was famous for coal production and construction material manufacturing. The capacity of the two industries took up more than 70 percent of the cityâs total before 2000.

With the adjustment of national industrial policy, many science parks in the district, including the Advanced Manufacturing Base, Petrifaction and New Material Base, Changyang Science Park, Liangxiang Advanced Education Area, Haiju Base, and Logistics Base have been included into the Zhongguancun Science Park in the October of 2012.

From then on, the Zhongguancun Science Park Fangshan Sub Park started to develop strategic emerging industries.

Wei Jianmin, general manger of Bejing Aoxiang Ventilation Device Company based in Fangshan Sub Park said that the entire air conditioning ventilation system in Beijing Subway is developed and produced by the company.

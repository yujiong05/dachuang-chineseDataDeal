China's low-orbit broadband communication satellite bears fruitful results

BEIJING -- China's first technology experiment satellite for low-orbit broadband communication has completed more than 180 communication tests and generated fruitful results, according to its developer Friday.

As the first satellite of the Hongyun Project, a low-orbit broadband communication satellite system developed by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), it has worked stably for more than 8,800 hours, carried out more than 5,000 instructions and conducted more than 20 in-orbit observation tests on a spectral thermometer.

It has obtained more than 70 GB of image data and verified the technology of low-orbit satellite Internet since it was launched on Dec. 22, 2018, according to the CASIC.

Ma Jie, an official from the CASIC, said they have tested the low-orbit broadband communication satellite system under different weather conditions and for different business scenarios, laying a good foundation for the construction of China's satellite Internet.

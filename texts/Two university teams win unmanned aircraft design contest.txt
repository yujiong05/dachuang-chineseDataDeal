Two university teams win unmanned aircraft design contest

The First Tianying Cup Unmanned Aircraft Design Competition concluded in Beijing on Friday.

Launched in August, the competition was jointly hosted by HiWing General Aviation Equipment Co Ltd and the Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics' Unmanned and Micro Aircraft Branch, and saw nearly 100 participating teams from domestic universities, institutes and military research entities.

Fourteen teams made it to the final in Beijing on Friday. Unmanned aircraft experts and designers from multiple domestic institutes specializing in this field judged the teams' presentation and voted winners.

Two teams, one from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics and another from Northwestern Polytechnical University, were crowned champions.

HiWing General Aviation Equipment is part of the State-owned defense giant China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp and is the conglomerate's only subsidiary researching unmanned aircraft.

Ma Hongzhong, chairman of HiWing General Aviation Equipment, said the competition was intended to enable young talented people to display their creativity, innovation and ideas and also encourage their exploration in science and technology.

He added that the company will continue making solid measures to help young professionals foster their innovation.

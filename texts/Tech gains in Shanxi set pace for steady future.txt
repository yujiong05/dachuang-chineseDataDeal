Tech gains in Shanxi set pace for steady future

Government work report hails progress in green energy, digital economy and welfare

Shanxi maintained sustainable socioeconomic development in 2024 and is expected to sustain this momentum this year, said a government work report during the third session of the 14th Shanxi Provincial People's Congress that concluded in Taiyuan city on Jan 21.

The government work report was delivered by Shanxi Governor Jin Xiangjun on Jan 17, the opening day of the conference.

The report said that Shanxi had made all-around achievements in the green energy industry, energy industry transformation, the digital economy and social welfare.

The report said the transaction volume of Shanxi's green electricity- generated from green energy resources like wind, solar and hydraulic power — reached 7.66 billion kilowatt-hours in 2024. The province is the largest supplier of green electricity to the country.

The digital economy's progress was marked by the number of Shanxi's 5G base stations reaching 108,000 last year and the fact that its comprehensive computing power index was among the top nationwide, according to the report.

The booming digital economy has helped to advance Shanxi's energy industry transformation. It features developing new energy resources and upgrading traditional coal mining toward smarter, safer and more environmentally friendly operations. The report said that Shanxi now has a total of 268 smart coal mines, ranking it first nationwide.

In the area of social welfare, Shanxi became the first provincial-level region in China in 2024 to subsidize all nonprofit child care institutions that offer services to children under the age of 3.

China launches new remote-sensing satellite on Long March 2D rocket

China successfully launched a Long March 2D carrier rocket on Wednesday morning, deploying a new remote-sensing satellite into orbit, according to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.

The state-owned space agency reported the rocket lifted off at 6:56 am local time from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province. It successfully delivered the Yaogan 42A satellite to its designated orbit.

Yaogan 42A is the latest addition to China's growing fleet of remote-sensing satellites. These spacecraft play a crucial role in Earth observation, utilizing reflected and emitted radiation to detect and monitor physical characteristics of objects on land and at sea.

The Long March 2D rocket, fueled by liquid propellants and boasting a liftoff thrust of 300 metric tons, is capable of launching 1.3-ton spacecraft into sun-synchronous orbits at roughly 700 kilometers in altitude.

Both the Yaogan 42A satellite and the Long March 2D rocket were designed and manufactured by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, a subsidiary of CASC.

This mission marks China's 15th rocket launch of 2024 and the 515th flight overall for the Long March rocket family, the nation's workhorse launch vehicle fleet.

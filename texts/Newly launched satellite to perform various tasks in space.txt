Newly launched satellite to perform various tasks in space

China launched a Long March 2D carrier rocket to send a multitasking satellite into orbit on Wednesday morning, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp.

The State-owned space contractor said in a news release that the rocket blasted off at 7:15 am at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China's Gobi Desert and transported the Yunhai 1-03 satellite into its preset orbit.

The satellite is tasked with surveying atmospheric, marine and space environments, providing data to support disaster prevention and mitigation efforts, and carrying out scientific experiments, it noted.

The Long March 2D rocket is propelled by liquid propellants and has a liftoff thrust of 300 metric tons. It is capable of sending spacecraft with a combined weight of 1.3 tons to a sun-synchronous orbit with an altitude of 700 kilometers.

Both the satellite and rocket were designed and built by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology.

The launch was the 438th flight of the Long March rocket fleet and China's 38th space mission this year. The country has planned to conduct more than 60 launches in 2022.

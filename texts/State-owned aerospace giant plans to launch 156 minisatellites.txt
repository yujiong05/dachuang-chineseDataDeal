State-owned aerospace giant plans to launch 156 minisatellites

BEIJING - State-owned China Aerospace Science & Industry Corp. (CASIC) announced plans for a network of 156 mini-satellites that would facilitate global broadband coverage.

This is the first low orbiting, networked satellite project, which will orbit 1,000 km above the ground, developed by China amid its wider push for commercial space development, said the CASIC.

"The network is a general satellite platform," said Bei Chao, an engineer with the CASIC, who added that add-ons and upgrades would be explored next.

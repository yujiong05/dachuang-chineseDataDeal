Space contractor launches events promoting intelligent industries

China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, a major space contractor, launched a series of events to promote intelligent industries, including big data, artificial intelligence, internet of things and cloud computing on Wednesday in Beijing.The events will include more than 10 forums, exhibitions, news conferences and business-matching meetings around the country, according to the company.More than 300 researchers and company representatives took part in the launch ceremony and shared their views and thoughts on intelligent industries’ development.Ma Tianhui, head of CASIC’s civilian businesses, said that the State-owned space giant wants to make use of its expertise in intelligent industries to help fulfill the government’s goal of building the "smart society" envisioned by the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last year.She said CASIC has developed more than 100 key technologies and nearly 360 products concerning intelligent industries.Xi Quansheng, president of China Aerospace Systems Engineering Co, a CASIC subsidiary responsible for intelligent industries, said that researchers are striving to develop a number of cutting-edge technologies that will be crucial to intelligent industries in the future.In April, CASIC established an intelligent industries research center and an intelligent industries alliance in Beijing.The research center will serve a wide range of sectors, such as transportation, agriculture, tourism, environmental protection and food and drug security.The intelligent industries alliance, which initially consists of several academies and firms under CASIC, is set to build a partnership among members and to foster cooperation in research, development and marketing for intelligent industries.

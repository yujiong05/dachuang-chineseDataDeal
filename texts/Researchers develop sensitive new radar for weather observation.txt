Researchers develop sensitive new radar for weather observation

China has developed a millimeter-wave cloud radar for Beijing's new international airport, offering weather forecasts with higher accuracy than previous generations.

The radar was developed by a research institute affiliated with the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, the country's leading radar maker. Established in 1958, the institute developed China's first wind-profiler radar for airports.

Hu Qingrong, director of the institute, said the millimeter-wave cloud radar can be used in various fields, such as atmospheric sciences, weather modification, automatic cloud observation, and weather services for aviation. It is capable of monitoring clouds, rain, fog and other conditions for meteorological departments, airports and ports.

Researchers have previously used the radar technology to collect weather data for the Shanghai Meteorological Service, providing support in forecasting heavy rain, blizzards and fog.

The system will be set up at the new airport in Beijing's southern Daxing district early next year. The airport is under construction and is expected to open by September.

Located 46 km south of downtown Beijing, the new airport will take pressure off the overcrowded Beijing Capital International Airport in the city's northeast.

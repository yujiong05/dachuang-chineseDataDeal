New broadcasting satellite fails to enter preset orbit

XICHANG, Sichuan - Communications satellite Zhongxing-9A, which was launched aboard the Long March-3B carrier rocket from southwest China's Xichang Satellite Launch Center at 12:11 a.m. Monday, has failed to enter the preset orbit.

Abnormal performance was identified during the third phase of the rocket launch, said the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) Monday.

The exact reason for the failure is under investigation and related parties are taking measures to address the problem and send the satellite into the correct orbit.

The solar panels and communication antennae, however, have been deployed and the satellite system is operating under normal conditions, according to the CASC.

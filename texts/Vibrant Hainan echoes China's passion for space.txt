Vibrant Hainan echoes China's passion for space

In recent years, China has experienced a remarkable surge in its space exploration endeavors, inspiring hundreds of rocket enthusiasts every day to flock to Longlou Town, a small town located in Wenchang, Hainan, with a permanent population of only 20,000 people. Of them, a bunch of youthful rocket fans follow China's rocket launches and record the moments of lift-off with their cameras. They proudly identify themselves as "Rocket Enthusiasts."

In this video, a French Gen-Z interviewer invited two of them to share their rocket-chasing experiences and enthusiasm for China's aerospace endeavors, exploring the charm and magic of rocket launches and their connections with China's passion for space.

As China's only low-latitude coastal space launch site, Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site has seen remarkable achievements in the development of China's space industry since its opening in 2016. With the increasing passion of China's young "rocket enthusiasts", the soaring rockets have created ripples of excitement, reflecting the passion of generations of Chinese space explorers and enthusiasts.

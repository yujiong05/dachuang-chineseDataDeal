High-end technologies empower manufacturers

High-end technologies have empowered manufacturers in Shandong, Tianjin and Inner Mongolia to achieve high-quality development.

In Shandong's Jining, there are 51 nationally recognized "little giant" companies with cutting-edge technologies.

Tianjin's government is establishing a comprehensive aerospace industry system, attracting 27 aerospace manufacturing enterprises, and a preliminary development pattern has been established, including aircraft, helicopters, drones, carrier rockets, satellites and super-large spacecraft.

These initiatives are injecting strong momentum into green and sustainable development, driving economic growth and fostering innovation in strategic industries.

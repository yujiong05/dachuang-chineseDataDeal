Long March-5 rocket fails, but time will not pass in vain

For people who care about China's Long March-5 Y2 carrier rocket and space industry, 7:23 p.m. on July 2, is a shocking moment. An anomaly occurred during takeoff, which made the launch unsuccessful.

The second launch of the Long March-5 carrier rocket was a test. The unsuccessful launch may delay Long March-5's commission in Chinaâs space transportation system.

Setbacks and failures are not rare in the history of manned spaceflight, but dreams of flying out of the atmosphere never stopped because of them.

Real courage and wisdom is shown in how people deal with unsuccessful missions or even failures. Failure is upsetting, but it also helps people to acquire hard-won experience. Sometimes, failure is more important than successâthis is the experience of Mr. Qian Xuesen, the father of China's space program.

Chinese aerospace engineers have never been afraid of failures, nor have they lost confidence, for six decades now. Facts show that the team is honorable.

âTime will not pass in vain. This night will be recorded in the historical record of China's aerospace industry,â said a reporter when he saw the calm expression on the face of Long Lehao, an eminent rocket scientist, after the launch failed on the night of July 2.

China launches experimental satellite into orbit

China launched an experimental satellite into space on Sunday evening, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, the nation's leading space contractor.

The satellite was built by the China Academy of Space Technology and is named Space-based Internet Technology Demonstrator. It was transported into its preset orbit by a Long March 2C carrier rocket that blasted off at 7:00 pm at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China's Gobi Desert.

The rocket class is 43 meters long and 3.35 meters wide and has a liftoff weight of 242.5 metric tons. It is mainly used to deploy satellites to low-Earth and sun-synchronous orbits.

The mission was China's 26th rocket launch this year, and marked the 478th flight of the Long March rocket family.

China is expected to carry out more than 70 space missions this year.

Nation's top aerospace brains meet PolyU scientists

Top national aerospace scientists on Thursday afternoon shared the latest space science and technology happenings with colleagues from Hong Kong Polytechnic University as part of their exchange tour in Hong Kong.

Apart from the three top-notch aerospace experts - Xie Jun, deputy chief designer of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System; Zhang He, executive director of the Chang'e 4 probe project; and Sun Zezhou, chief designer of Tianwen 1, five young scientists from China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the state-owned satellite and rocket maker, also took to the stage to share their quest for science.

About 40 people, including 23 faculty members and students from the university – most of whom participated in previous national aerospace missions, joined the event. The university has been an active participant in the nation's deep-space missions.

It is part of a series of activities being held across the city during a five-day visit by six of the nation's top aerospace experts. Also in Hong Kong are Qi Faren, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and the chief designer of the first Shenzhou manned spaceship; Hu Hao, chief designer of China's third-phase lunar exploration project; and Long Lehao, chief designer of China's Long March Rockets Series.

The national scientists gave face-to-face talks at the PolyU and the University of Hong Kong on Wednesday and Thursday, and will meet secondary school students on Friday.

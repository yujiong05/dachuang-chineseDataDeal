China launches rocket to deploy Earth-observation satellite

China launched a Long March 4C rocket at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwestern China's Gobi Desert to deploy an Earth-observation radar satellite on Sunday morning, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, the nation's leading space contractor.

The rocket blasted off at 7:44 am and soon placed the 3.2 metric ton Land Surveyor 1-01B satellite in a quasi-sun-synchronous orbit about 607 kilometers above the ground and will team up with its predecessor -- Land Surveyor 1-01A that was launched on Jan 26 – to use their L-band synthetic aperture radars to carry out round-the-clock, all-weather observation of ground areas, the State-owned conglomerate said in a statement.

Both the satellite and the rocket were built by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology. The launch marked the 408th flight of the Long March rocket family and the third space mission by China.

After their in-orbit tests, the two-satellite system will be tasked with providing data and images to land resources, disaster prevention and relief, mapping, and forestry authorities and will extensively strengthen the rapid response capability for major natural disasters, according to the space administration.

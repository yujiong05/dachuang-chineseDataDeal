Adaptive reuse projects offer urban reprieve

CHONGQING — A subtle revival is emerging in China's consumption landscape. Abandoned factories hum with art fairs, century-old alleyways lure crowds with craft beer and trendy cinemas, and 70-year-old neighborhoods have been transformed into hybrid art-retail hubs.

Dubbed "adaptive reuse", this trend redefines consumption by blending nostalgia with modern lifestyles, catering to a growing demand for unique, experience-driven destinations.

In Southwest China's Chongqing, the centuries-old Luzu Temple has been renovated as a commercial complex that integrates shopping, art and social interaction while preserving its historical charm.

Within the complex, a Cantonese restaurant serves authentic Hong Kong-style cuisine and retro decor, which creates a distinctive atmosphere that draws both residents and tourists. The 70-square-meter shop generates an average monthly revenue of 300,000 yuan ($41,400).

"Today's consumers are looking for more than just products; they crave unique vibes and immersive experiences," says Shu Chang, the restaurant's manager.

This shift is evident across the country, from Chengdu's Eastern Suburb Memory, a repurposed factory-turned-art district, to Shanghai's Hongshoufang area, where historical architecture meets modern retail.

As China's younger generation gradually becomes the backbone of the consumer market, traditional retail has found it challenging to fulfill their demands for culture, art and socialization.

"Adaptive reuse spaces, often set in factories or public areas, resonate with young people," says Tang Zhengyi, an executive at the Chongqing branch of Cushman & Wakefield, a property consulting and service firm.

In Chongqing, Peiping Machine, a brewery that originated in Beijing, opened a new store in a heritage-protected building. Patrons enjoy craft beer and savory pancakes while watching classic films, creating an enchanting blend of nostalgia and contemporary culture.

"Craft beer carries local and cultural identities. We engage with communities through our events," says Dai Kan, the brand's manager.

The trend extends beyond commerce, fostering urban renewal and community integration. In Chongqing's Minzhucun in Jiulongpo district, a 70-year-old neighborhood began revitalizing in 2021, and now trendy shops coexist with residential areas.

Yao Yuanzhu runs an art-inspired home goods store in a residential building, which fuses creativity with daily life. "Our concept is based on merging art and life. Adaptive reuse commerce in communities lets consumers explore and be surprised," he says.

Tang from the property consulting and service firm says: "Youth crave personalized expression and warm social interactions. Adaptive reuse commerce offers a haven, some emotional value and a curated experience."

Chai Xinxin, a Shanghai resident, often visits pet-friendly outdoor venues with her cat. "After a hectic day at the office, I need a space to unwind. These spots help me meet fellow cat lovers and feel a sense of belonging."

With their unique appeal, adaptability to shifting consumer values, and role in urban renewal, adaptive reuse projects are emerging as a new growth engine for consumption.

"They embody both local culture and city vitality," Tang says.

"By deepening community roots and fostering neighborhood synergy, they represent the future of urban commerce."

Youth charity conference wraps up in Zhuhai

The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Youth Charity Annual Conference recently drew to a close in Zhuhai, Guangdong province.

Organized by the China Soong Ching Ling Foundation, the event served as a platform for impassioned youth from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao to come together, sharing their experiences and insights gleaned from active involvement in charitable initiatives and volunteer services.

Among the attendees was Liang Xiyan, a student from Zhuhai, who, guided by her parents, has wholeheartedly devoted herself to numerous volunteer activities and charitable causes. Liang emphasized the significance of small acts of kindness and urged fellow young people to extend a helping hand to those in need.

Similarly, Wong Cheng-iao from Macao recounted poignant moments from her volunteer work, underscoring that the intrinsic rewards of kindness far surpass the efforts invested. "For me, the true reward lies in the kindness itself," she said.

In addition to the enriching discussions, participants had the opportunity to visit the Zhuhai Space Center, where they gained insights into the developments and progress within China's aerospace industry.

Moreover, the conference unveiled 103 charity projects for 2024, spanning categories such as poverty alleviation, educational assistance, and cultural heritage preservation. These initiatives aim to provide a comprehensive platform for youth in the Greater Bay Area, fostering their growth and development through meaningful engagement in public service activities.

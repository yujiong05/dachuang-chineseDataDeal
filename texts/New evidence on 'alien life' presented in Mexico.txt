New evidence on 'alien life' presented in Mexico

China has yet to find any solid evidence about the existence of extraterrestrial aliens, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, the country's dominant space contractor and one of the world's largest space enterprises.

"So far, we have not found any conclusive evidence about aliens' existence during our space activities," the State-owned conglomerate said on Thursday in a reply on Zhihu, China's largest Quora-like question-and-answer site.

The brief statement was a response to a request for the Zhihu users' comment on the appearance of two so-called alien corpses at a hearing of Mexican lawmakers on Tuesday local time.

Jaime Maussan, a Mexican journalist and self-proclaimed "ufologist", presented what he said were thousand-year-old "non-human" corpses at the hearing held by Mexico's Congress.

Video clips taken at the hearing show the two tiny "alien bodies" displayed in cases with three fingers on each hand and elongated heads.

According to Maussan, they were recovered in 2017 in Peru near the ancient Nazca Lines and they were about 1,000 years old, analyzed by a carbon dating process by the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

"This is the first time (extraterrestrial life) has been presented in such a form and I think there is a clear demonstration that we are dealing with non-human specimens that are not related to any other species in our world," Maussan was quoted by Washington Post as he spoke to lawmakers under oath. "We are not alone."

His statement and the display of "alien bodies" soon went viral on internet, with many saying this might be another evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial lives. Some scientists have said they do not believe the items shown at the hearing are real aliens.

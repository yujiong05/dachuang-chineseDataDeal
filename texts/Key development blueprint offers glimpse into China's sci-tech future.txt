Key development blueprint offers glimpse into China's sci-tech future

BEIJING - A blueprint for China's development in the next five to 15 years has garnered wide attention as it offers a glimpse into the country's innovation path and future sci-tech scenes.

China will uphold the central role of innovation in its modernization drive and make greater efforts to achieve breakthroughs in key and core technologies, according to the draft outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for national economic and social development and the long-range objectives through the year 2035.

The draft outline, which is under review by lawmakers and political advisors across the country at the annual "two sessions," shed light on a future where people lead a more digitalized life, and scientists blaze new trails in frontier areas such as next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) and gene technology.

"We need to strengthen sci-tech innovation in key areas related to the country's long-term competitiveness," said Hao Yue, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences who is also a national political advisor.

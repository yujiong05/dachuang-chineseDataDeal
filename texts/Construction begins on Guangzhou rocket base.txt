Construction begins on Guangzhou rocket base

Construction of a new rocket production base began on Monday in the Nansha district of Guangzhou, Guangdong province.

Covering about 40 hectares, the rocket production facility, situated at the mouth of the Pearl River, is expected to be able to produce more than 30 carrier rockets annually after operations get underway in early 2022.

Zheng Jun, vice-chairman of Beijing CAS Aerospace Exploration Technology Co, said his company will further expand its cooperation with Nansha district to ensure early completion of the project in the coming months.

"The facility will help promote research and development, production and general assembly of aviation aircraft and spacecraft in Nansha district and strive to make Guangzhou one of the production bases for China's aerospace industry," Zheng said at the commencement ceremony.

He added that the city will establish the country's first commercial aerospace industrial park and help enterprises in Guangzhou and nearby cities upgrade their industrial structures in the years ahead.

Facilities in Nansha will be capable of design, manufacturing, assembly and testing of rockets, Zheng said.

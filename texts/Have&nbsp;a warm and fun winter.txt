Once winter approaches, a warm place filled with fun is generally chilly peoplesâ first choice. The following five places in Taicang would satisfy all their requirements.

Modern Agriculture Park

To the east of Taicang, the park is an ideal holiday resort with elements of greenery, ecology, technology and culture.

With a modern agriculture pavilion, a mushroom pavilion, a gardening pavilion, and an ecological wetland pavilion, the park is a perfect destination during weekends for families.

The gardening pavilion is a temperature-controllable glasshouse for nearly 20 mini parks of tropical plants, flowers, and potted landscapes and over 480 species of vegetation are on display.

The ecological wetland pavilion is actually an artificial indoor ecological wetland. The pavilion simulates the natural wetland and breeds sea turtles, corals, fancy carp and other ornamental fishes.

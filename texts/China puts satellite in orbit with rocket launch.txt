China puts satellite in orbit with rocket launch

China launched a Long March 3B carrier rocket on Thursday evening to deploy a communication satellite to space.

The rocket blasted off at 7:50 pm at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province and then placed the ChinaSat 9B satellite in orbit, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp.

The launch marked the 78th flight of the Long March 3B and the 388th of the Long March fleet.

The State-owned space conglomerate said in a statement the ChinaSat 9B was designed based on the DFH-4E satellite platform and is tasked with transmitting radio and television signals.

The satellite will be operated by the company’s subsidiary — China Satellite Communications – and is expected to work for at least 15 years.

By now, China Satellite Communications has owned 15 communication satellites covering China, southern and southeastern Asia, the Middle East, and some parts of Europe and Africa.

Updated: 2022-03-02

According to the executive committee of the 2022 China International Big Data Industry Expo, the expo has so far attracted the participation of 84 companies, including China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, China Mobile, and Fuji Film.

Guiyang Big Data Industry Co has assigned employees to join the executive committee and invite guests, plan for seminars, purchase items for projects, attract exhibitors, and provide logistical support.

According to the company, the method of attracting exhibitors for this year's expo is more professional, standard, targeted and customized. The expo will consist of different exhibition areas with themes like digital China, digital trade, data centers, computing nodes, digital security, low-carbon and recycling, cloud services, and green energy.

Exhibition areas will work to attract central-government-owned enterprises based on these themes.

The 2022 Big Data Expo will be held both online and offline. The offline exhibition will focus on the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) and development trends in big data. There will be six exhibition halls covering a total area of 60,000 square meters.

The online exhibition will be held throughout the year and serve as a platform to provide business opportunities for both exhibitors and visitors.

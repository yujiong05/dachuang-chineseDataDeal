China launches experimental satellite into space

China launched a Long March 3B carrier rocket on Thursday night to deploy an experimental satellite into space, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, the nation's dominant space contractor.

The State-owned conglomerate said in a news release that the rocket blasted off at 11:32 pm from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province and soon placed the satellite, named Communication Technology Demonstrator 14, in its intended orbit.

The satellite was built by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, a CASC subsidiary, and is tasked with verifying space-based communications, television and radio signal relay and data transmission technologies, according to the release.

The Long March 3B model, developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, also a CASC subsidiary, is one of China most used rocket types and features good operational record. It stands at 56.3 meters and has a diameter of 3.35 meters. Propelled by liquid-propellant engines, the rocket has three stages and four 2.25-meter-wide side boosters, and weighs 456 metric tons when filled with fuels.

It is mainly used to launch satellites into geostationary transfer orbit and can transport 5.5 tons of payloads to such orbit. It can also send spacecraft to other kinds of orbits such as medium-Earth and lunar transfer orbits.

The mission was China's sixth rocket launch this year and the 558th flight of the Long March rocket family, the nation's main launch vehicle fleet.

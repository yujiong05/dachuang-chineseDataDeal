Chinese automaker Chery launches new cars in Czech Republic

PRAGUE - Chinese automaker Chery has officially launched four new models of its OMODA 5 and JAECOO 7 in the Czech market.

Attending the launch event Wednesday in the Czech capital were more than 700 people including officials, representatives of trade associations, automobile dealers and Chery's business partners.

Calling sustainable development and green transition a global consensus, Chinese Ambassador to the Czech Republic Feng Biao told the audience that in the field of new energy vehicles, China is willing to engage in mutually beneficial cooperation with the Czech Republic and share technological expertise, making joint efforts to combat climate change and contributing to global sustainable development.

Cooperation between Chinese and Czech businesses would help advance economic and trade relations between the two countries, improving the well-being of the two peoples, Feng added.

Shen Zaoshi, deputy general manager of Chery's European Union region, told Xinhua that Chery has conducted extensive market research to ensure the new models launched would meet local consumers' demands.

Noting that the Czech automotive market is relatively mature with consumers with strong purchasing power, Shen said that Chery, with its technological and product advantages, would provide local consumers with more options.

According to the company, Chery will collaborate with its local partner Grand Automotive Central Europe to establish a sales and service network, with about 30 sales outlets to be set up in the Czech Republic by the end of 2025.

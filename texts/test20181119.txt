China launched twin Beidou-3 satellites successfully at 02：07am on Monday, enabling the domestically developed satellite system to expand its coverage to countries involved in the Belt and Road initiative by year's end.

The satellites were sent on a Long March-3B carrier rocket in Southwest China's Xichang Satellite Launch Center and are the 46th and 47th of the Beidou Navigation Satellite System.

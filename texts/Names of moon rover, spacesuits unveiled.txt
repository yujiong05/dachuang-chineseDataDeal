Names of moon rover, spacesuits unveiled

China unveiled on Wednesday the names of the spacesuits and manned rovers that will be used on future moon missions.

According to a news release from the China Manned Space Agency, the new spacesuits, which will be worn by astronauts as they walk on the lunar surface, are called Wangyu, or "Stargazing", while the manned rover is Tansuo, or "Exploration".

The agency explained that the word wangyu symbolizes a new chapter in China's space endeavor that features manned missions to the moon and deep-space expeditions and also demonstrates the country's determination to uphold the peaceful use of outer space and pursue a shared future of humanity.

Tansuo represents the Chinese people's exploration of the unknown world and embodies the spirit of the relentless progress made by people working for the nation's manned space programs, according to the agency.

The names were reviewed and chosen by a group of experts out of more than 9,000 proposals, which were solicited from the public.

Currently, prototypes of the spacesuit and rover are being designed, and the research work has been progressing smoothly, it said.

Wang Yanan, chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said on Wednesday that selecting a good name for hardware involved in the manned lunar program is "very important and meaningful".

"An attractive and poetic name can contain a lot of meanings and implications, and can draw attention from the public, especially children and youngsters. It is not uncommon that an appealing name has proved to be helpful and effective in catching people's eyes and arousing their interest and support," he said, citing the examples of the Shenzhou crew spaceships and Chang'e lunar probes.

China launches Yaogan 39 remote sensing satellite

China launched a Long March 2D carrier rocket on Sunday afternoon at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province to place several remote-sensing satellites into orbit, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp.

The State-owned space contractor said in a news release that the rocket blasted off at 12:13 pm and transported the Yaogan 39 satellites into their preset orbital positions.

Remote-sensing satellites refer to those tasked with observing, surveying and measuring objects on land and at sea, as well as monitoring the weather forecast.

The Yaogan family is the largest fleet of remote-sensing spacecraft in China and their data has been widely used in governments, public service sectors and businesses.

Yaogan 39 satellites were developed by the China Academy of Space Technology and the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, both of which are subsidiaries of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, one of the world's largest space contractors.

Long March 2D, designed and built by the Shanghai academy, is propelled by liquid propellants and has a liftoff thrust of 300 metric tons. It is capable of sending a 1.3-ton spacecraft to a typical sun-synchronous orbit with an altitude of 700 kilometers.

The mission was China's 43rd rocket launch this year and the 488th flight of the Long March rocket family, the nation's main launch vehicle fleet. It also marked the 30th space mission conducted by China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp.

China plans to carry out about 70 space missions this year, and if this comes true, 2023 will become the busiest year for Chinese carrier rockets.

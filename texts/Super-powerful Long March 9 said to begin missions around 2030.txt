Super-powerful Long March 9 said to begin missions around 2030

Chinese scientists are designing what is expected to be the world's most powerful rocket, according to a senior researcher.

Li Hong, deputy general manager at China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, said the Long March 9 super heavy-lift carrier rocket will be capable of lifting 140 metric tons of payload into a low-Earth orbit, or a 50-ton spacecraft to a lunar transfer orbit. The giant rocket will also be able to ferry a 44-ton payload to a Mars transfer orbit, he added.

He made the remarks on Saturday on the sidelines of the ongoing second session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing. The researcher is a member of the national political advisory body.

Advanced comms satellite launched from Sichuan

China launched a Long March 3B carrier rocket on Thursday evening at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Southwest China's Sichuan province to transport a communications satellite into orbit, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp.

ChinaSat 26 was put into a geostationary orbit by the rocket that blasted off at 7:49 pm.

Developed by the China Academy of Space Technology in Beijing, a CASC subsidiary, the satellite uses a DFH-4E structure and connects user devices mounted on cars, ships and aircraft to high-speed broadband internet.

According to designers at the academy, the ChinaSat 26 is the most advanced civilian communications satellite in China and its overall capability is on par with the best in the world. The craft has the largest transmission capacity among all Chinese communications satellites -- 100 gigabits per second.

Once the satellite starts formal operation, it will become a pillar of China's high-throughput satellite network, designers said.

The launch marks the 463rd mission of the Long March family and China's sixth rocket liftoff in 2023, as well as the first flight of the Long March 3B model.

In 2023, the nation plans to carry out around 60 launch missions, including manned and robotic flights to the Tiangong space station and the maiden flight of the Long March 6C.

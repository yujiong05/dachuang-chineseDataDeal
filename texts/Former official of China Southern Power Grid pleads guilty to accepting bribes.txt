Former official of China Southern Power Grid pleads guilty to accepting bribes

Long Fei, former official of the China Southern Power Grid Company Ltd, pleaded guilty to accepting bribes while standing trial in Yantai, Shandong province, on Friday.

Prosecutors found that Long, from 2000 to 2023, took advantage of his positions, including head of the general office with the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation and member of the leading Party members group of the China Southern Power Grid Company Ltd, to seek benefits for others in various matters such as business operation and project contracting, and accepted bribes worth more than 6.13 million yuan ($845,547) in return.

With evidence provided, the prosecutors said that Long should be held criminal liable for bribe-taking.

During the trial, Long and his lawyer also shared opinions on the evidence, and Long confessed to the crime in his final statement.

The Yantai Intermediate People's Court said that the verdict will be announced at a later date.

More than 30 people, including national lawmakers, political advisers and journalists, attended the case hearing.

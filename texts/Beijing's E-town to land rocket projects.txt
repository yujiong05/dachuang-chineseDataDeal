Beijing's E-town to land rocket projects

One of Chinaâs largest space technology companies has settled many of its rocket development projects at Beijing Economic Development Area (E-town), according to reports from Cultural Herald on Jan 25.

The China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) first agreed to set up a base in E-town last October, operating a range of businesses, from space launch, in-orbit service, space data application, ground service, to space travel. CALT is also expected to establish a rocket R&D center there in the near future.

Decision to relocate to E-town is an ambitious one by State-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, CALTâs parent company, as it seeks to commercialize its advanced rocket technology.

CALT is ready for these projects to move forward as soon as possible and is seeking finance, land, and policy support from E-town, according to Li Hong, CALTâs president, during a tour of E-town on Jan 24.

Wang Hesheng, a senior official of E-townâs administration, expressed his eagerness to cooperate more with CALT in the future and help to contribute towards the national space industry.

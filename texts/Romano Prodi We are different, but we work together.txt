Romano Prodi: We are different, but we work together

"We are now in the moment of change… And I do think that in many cases cooperation between China and Europe could be useful," said Romano Prodi, former prime minister of Italy and former president of the European Commission. In a recent interview with China Daily, he said China and Italy are different, but the two nations can work together to contribute to each other.

New rocket engine to lift heavier satellite load

China has developed a world-class solid-propellant rocket engine that is expected to boost the country's capabilities in launching small satellites, its developer said.

The Academy of Aerospace Solid Propulsion Technology in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, a subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, announced that the first ignition test of the engine was successfully made on Tuesday.

The academy said in a statement that the engine uses several advanced technologies and high-performance composite materials and has world-class capability. It can be used with the country's new-generation solid-fuel rockets, giving such rockets more power to lift small satellites and also promising good competitiveness in the commercial launch market, it said.

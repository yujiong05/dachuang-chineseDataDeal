Kuaizhou 1A rocket launches from Gobi Desert

China launched a Kuaizhou 1A carrier rocket on Friday evening from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the country's northwestern Gobi Desert, marking the beginning of its space plans for 2024.

The solid-propellant rocket blasted off at 7:20 pm from its launch vehicle and placed four satellites in the Tianmu 1 meteorological observation network into their preset orbits, according to China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, one of the nation's major State-owned space contractors.

The company said in a news release that the satellites are tasked with surveying atmospheric environmental elements around the globe.

The mission marked the 25th flight of the Kuaizhou 1A model as well as the type's third liftoff over the past two weeks with the previous two launches also used to transport a total of eight Tianmu 1 series satellites into space.

Developed by China Space Sanjiang Group, a CASIC subsidiary in Hubei province, the 20-meter Kuaizhou 1A has a liftoff weight of about 30 metric tons. It is capable of sending 200 kilograms of payload into a sun-synchronous orbit, or 300 kg of payload into a low-Earth orbit, according to its designers.

By now, 22 satellites in the Tianmu network have been deployed in space. Upon its completion, the network will be used to conduct integrated measurements of oceans, the atmosphere and the ionosphere round the clock. It will provide accurate weather data to meteorological authorities and industry users for forecasts and other purposes, according to the release.

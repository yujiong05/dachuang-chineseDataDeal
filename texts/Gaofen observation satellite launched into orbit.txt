Gaofen observation satellite launched into orbit

China launched a Gaofen 12C high-resolution Earth observation satellite late Monday night, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp.

The satellite was lifted into orbit on a Long March 4C carrier rocket that blasted off at 11:46 pm from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China. It is tasked with land mapping, urban construction planning, agricultural yield forecasting, disaster prevention and relief and other operations, the State-owned space contractor said in a news release.

Both the satellite and the rocket were built by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, a CASC subsidiary.

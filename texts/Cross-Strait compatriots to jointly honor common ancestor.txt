Cross-Strait compatriots to jointly honor common ancestor

BEIJING -- Compatriots across the Taiwan Strait will attend events honoring China's legendary ancestor Huangdi, or the Yellow Emperor, on the mainland during the upcoming Qingming Festival, or Tomb-Sweeping Day, a mainland spokesperson said Wednesday.

Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said the commemorative ceremonies and related cultural activities will be held in Shaanxi and Henan provinces.

The Yellow Emperor is recognized as the cultural ancestor of the Chinese nation, with his mausoleum serving as a spiritual symbol of Chinese civilization, according to Chen.

He emphasized that the joint ceremonies by compatriots across the Taiwan Strait boast a long tradition, which plays a significant role in preserving Chinese cultural heritage and strengthening Taiwan compatriots' sense of national identity, belonging and pride.

Additionally, regarding the fact that the Xiamen section of the Xiamen-Kinmen Bridge has entered a new construction phase, Chen said, constructing the bridge is a shared aspiration and urgent desire among residents on both sides.

He added that the mainland has always prioritized the well-being of people in Kinmen, and has implemented multiple measures to benefit them in recent years, including a cross-Strait water supply project.

Since it began transferring water through the project in 2018, Fujian Province has provided over 40 million tonnes of water for Kinmen, effectively resolving the island's long-standing water shortage issues, according to the spokesperson.

Xi chairs leadership meeting on eco-protection inspection regulations, disciplinary inspection

BEIJING -- Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, on Monday chaired a leadership meeting to review a set of regulations on ecological and environmental protection inspection.

The meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also reviewed a report on the fourth round of disciplinary inspection launched by the 20th CPC Central Committee.

The meeting said the inspection of the ecological and environmental protection work has achieved positive results, by pushing officials at all levels to fulfill their political duties, handling a number of major cases of ecological and environmental damage and solving a batch of prominent environment problems that have been complained about by the people.

The meeting emphasized the need to uphold and strengthen the Party's leadership over environmental protection inspections, continue leveraging the role of inspections as a powerful tool, and further hold localities and departments accountable for their political obligations to advance the building of a Beautiful China.

It stressed the importance of having the courage to tackle tough issues, persistently uncover and earnestly address problems, and enhance the effectiveness of implementing the Party Central Committee's decisions and plans on ecological civilization.

On the disciplinary inspection, the meeting said some problems had been uncovered by inspection teams that went to central Party and state institutions. These problems must be seriously rectified, it added.

Noting that the year 2025 is pivotal for expanding disciplinary inspection to cover all areas, the meeting said the focus must be placed on the implementation of the Party Central Committee's decisions and plans to provide strong guarantees for advancing Chinese modernization.

The meeting also discussed other matters.

China sends three more satellites into space

China used a Long March 6 carrier rocket to transport three experimental satellites into space on Tuesday morning, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, a leading State-owned space contractor.

The company said in a news release that the rocket blasted off at 7:50 am at the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in Shanxi province and soon placed the Shiyan 16A and 16B and the Shiyan 17 satellites into their orbits. The satellites will be used to survey land resources and collect data for urban construction planning and disaster prevention and mitigation, it said.

The launch mission marked the 440th flight of the Long March rocket family and the 10th of the Long March 6 model, the company noted.

The 29.3-meter Long March 6 is capable of placing about 1 metric ton of payload into a sun-synchronous orbit 700 kilometers above the ground.

Tuesday's mission also marked the second rocket launch China has carried out in the past 12 hours.

On Monday night, a Long March 2D rocket launched at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province and deployed the Yaogan 36-01A, 36-01B and 36-01C remote-sensing satellites into space.

By now, China has conducted 41 of more than 60 planned space missions this year.

These jets stopped in Hohhot for supplies and then will fly to Zhuhai, Guangdong province, to attend the 11th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition held in Zhuhai from Nov 1 to 6.

In the following days, itâs expected that about 13 aerobatic jets (five Sukhoi-27 jets, six Mikoyan-29 jets, two Ilyushin-76 jets) which make up two performing teams, âKnightsâ and âSwiftsâ, and 103 performing pilots or support staff will arrive in Hohhot, according to the local immigration inspection station.

For the convenience of these flyers, the Hohhot Immigration Inspection Station has arranged several mobile inspecting vehicles on the parking apron, which cuts down on a lot of procedures and time. Furthermore, the station has picked out high-professional officers, especially those who can speak English or Russian, to assist in the work.

As one of worldâs largest air exhibitions, the Zhuhai airshow is sponsored by the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, the Guangdong Provincial Peopleâs Government, the China South Industries Group Corporation, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, and many other supporters.

The Russian Air Forceâs âKnightsâ and âSwiftsâ teams will be two of many groups to perform at the Zhuhai air show. For example, the Bayi Aerobatic Team of the Chinese PLA Air Force will also take to the skies for a show during the exhibition.

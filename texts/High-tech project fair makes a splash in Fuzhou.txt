This year's 618 Fair is divided to five zones. The professional zone consists of four pavilions of machinery, digital information, energy conservation and modern agriculture.

The general zone gathers scientific inventions from top-notch institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Science, Chinese Academy of Engineering and new products from across Fujian province.

The 21st Century Maritime Silk Road zone, as the names suggests, showcases advanced and applicable technology and projects from countries and regions along the Silk Road.

At the Virtual Research Institution zone, visitors can learn about the Cooperation Management Platform (CMP) and a lot of innovative products by five industrial technology research institutes.

The Financial Service zone promotes branded products from banks, insurance companies, securities firms and assets management agencies.

The theme of the innovation drive is âpushing Fujianâs intelligent manufacturingâ, echoing the âMade in China 2025â goal set by Premier Li Keqiang calling for enhancing the manufacturing industry by 2025.

The China Academy of Machinery Science and Technology opened a 2,000-sq-m Internet Economy pavilion exhibiting products from the Internet of Things, cloud service, Internet finance, agricultural Internet and cultural creativity media.

The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporationâs pavilion is among the most eye-catching , displaying models of the Long March rocket, Rainbow drones and real unmanned helicopters.

To encourage mass innovation, the fair also presents nearly 90 inventions by front-line workers from across the Taiwan Straits.

A total of 5,273 deals were signed in last yearâs 618 Fair, and 4,110 of them have started investment and construction, figures show.

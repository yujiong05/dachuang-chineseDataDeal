Man in moon may soon be Chinese

China's space authority said on Tuesday it plans to build a manned scientific research outpost on the moon.

In a video displayed at a ceremony in Harbin, provincial capital of Heilongjiang, the China National Space Administration published the country's achievements and development road maps in the space sector, including a plan to construct and operate a scientific research station on the moon.

The ceremony was held to mark the third China Space Day, April 24, the date in 1970 when China launched its first satellite.

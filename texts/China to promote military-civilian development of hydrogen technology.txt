China to promote military-civilian development of hydrogen technology

BEIJING -- A hydrogen engineering and technology research and development center was launched by China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) in Beijing on Wednesday, marking a boost of the military-civilian development of hydrogen technology.

The center is aimed at promoting the wide use of hydrogen in both national defence and civilian applications.

It will also focus on hydrogen production and storage technology with high efficiency and low costs, according to Tan Yonghua, an official with CASC.

The center will provide technical support for the industrial chain of hydrogen applications, he said.

The center currently has three academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is expected to have totally independent intellectual property rights and establish the hydrogen industrial chain and technology system.

Hydrogen is considered one of the most promising clean energy resources in the 21st century, since it has extensive sources and wide usage.
